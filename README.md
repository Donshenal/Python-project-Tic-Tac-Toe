# Python-project-Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. 
The game involves two players taking turns to place their marks (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. 
The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `tic_tac_toe.py` file.
2. Players take turns to enter a number from 1 to 9 to place their mark on the grid.
3. The game will display the updated grid after each move.
4. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. 
5. If the grid is completely filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## File Structure

- `tic_tac_toe.py`: Contains the Python code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `README.md`: Provides information and instructions for the game.

## Implementation Details

- The game features a basic ASCII representation of the game board.
